* Functional
* Pseudo code

# Design notations
### Static
## ERDs
## Class diagrams
## Structure charts

## Object diagrams

### Dynamic
## Data flow diagrams
Used primarily for pipe-and-filter styles of architecture. Graph-based diagrammatic notation.

## State transition diagrams
Used for capturing transition behaviour in cases where there is an intuitive finite collections of states.
* E.g.: a telephone call
* Derivces from the notation of a finite state automation

- Graph-based diagrammatic notation.
- Labeled nodes correspond to states.
- Arcs correspond to transitions.
- Arcs are labeled with events and actions.
- Describes a single underlying process.
## Statecharts
## Collaboration diagrams

## Detailed design
* Concerned with producing a short design specification(minispec) of each function. This should describe the processing, inputs and outputs.
* These descriptions should be managed in a data dictionary
