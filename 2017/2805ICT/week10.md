# UI Design 
* 

## Requirements Prototyping
* Most addresses the UI part of the requirements in terms of:
    * Visual looks
    * Flow 
* Performed in:
    * High fidelity
    * Low fidelity

## UI Design
* Psychology: building a mental model
* Ergonomics: facilitating navigation

## The design of everyday things
* Norman's principles of usability:
    - Visibility : frequently used functions should be obvious and easy
    - Mapping 
    - Feedback

## More UI Principles... (do not need to memorise all)

* Less is more: less important features out of the way (used by Google)
* Anticipation: hide or grey out inactivate features
* Customization: give expert users more efficient features

## Two approaches to UI design
* Lisa Lopuck's 3 steps to UI design:
1. Identify your audience and message
2. Determine the setting
3. 


## Prototyping a UI
* Implementation paradox:

## Low-fidelity prototypes
* 

## Plan test scenarios for prototypes


## User centered evaluation
* Formative evaluation during development (cook tastes soup)
* Summative evaluation of completion of project (guests taste soup)
* Which kind is a paper prototype?
* When should you test with actual users?

## Even Driven Programming




## High-fidelity prototypes
